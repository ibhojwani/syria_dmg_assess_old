# To do:
 - [ ] parallelize data downloading (Ty)
 - [ ] automate creation of sub-area geojson based on min/max values from UNOSAT data
 - [ ] decide on MPI vs mapreduce vs whatever else 
 - [ ] create a diagram/map of how code relates to one another
 - [ ] identify steps to take when pre-processing images
 - [ ] train a trial NN for classification
 - [ ] create a workflow to check if a point from UNOSAT data is in a given geojson geometry with geopandas (look at spatial join functions)
