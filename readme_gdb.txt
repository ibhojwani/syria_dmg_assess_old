This zip file contains a geodatabase with vector data depicting damage to multiple Syrian cities as of 2016, and including previous years analysis dating to the start of the Syrian conflict as well. An MXD file for easy visualization in ArcMap 10.3 is also provided in the zip file. Geodatabase contents are:

	1. Administrative: this feature dataset contains Neighborhood polygons for most analyzed areas as well as Settlement boundary polygons. These were extracted from Wikimapia by UNOSAT in 2016.
	2. Areas of Interest: this feature dataset contains the analyzed areas for the Damascus area damage analysis.
	3. Cloud_Cover: this feature dataset describes areas obscured by clouds and therefore unanalyzed; this is limited to Aleppo and Idlib for the 2014 analysis.
	4. Comprehensive_Damage_Analysis: this feature dataset contains the bulk of the UNOSAT Comprehensive Damage Assessment (CDA) for Syrian cities, including analysis of areas east of Damascus, Daraa, Deir ez Zor, Hama, Homs, Idlib, and Raqqa. Note that Aleppo data is described below in the 'Shelter_Damage_Assessment' section. Data for these cities includes all data points for all types of structures, but excluding the areas described in the 'No_Analysis_Areas_OFDA_REACH' feature dataset. The data structure for these CDA datasets is similar to the usual damage assessment datasets produced by UNOSAT but with additional information as this analysis has been repeated yearly since 2013. Most fields are self-explanatory but special attention needs to be paid to field headings as different cities have been analyzed with different timeframes. Specifically, the initial analysis for a city is described in 'Main_Damage_Site_Class', with the next analysis being contained in 'Main_Damage_Site_Class_2', then 'Main_Damage_Site_Class_3', and so on. For each update, the date of the image analyzed is contained in the 'SensorDate', 'SensorDate_2', 'SensorDate_3', and so on. With these fields users can represent all the damage detected in multiple years by filtering and querying as needed. The MXD file will load the data correctly in ArcMap 10.3 and later versions. In general, the filters for any year should exclude Null values. In addition, note that in a tiny fraction of the points a 'No Visible Damage' value was assigned. These values were used when a previously damaged building appeared to be repaired. So, for example, to represent damage for the 'Damage_Sites_Idlib_CDA' for the 2015 analysis (3), this query or selection would be used: "Main_Damage_Site_Class_3 Is Not Null And Main_Damage_Site_Class_3 <> No Visible Damage". 

	5. No_Analysis_Areas_OFDA_REACH: this feature dataset describes areas not analyzed by UNOSAT, and are generally military facilities. In Aleppo this also includes industrial areas as of this release.

	6. Shelter_Damage_Assessment: this feature dataset includes the Shelter Damage Assessment (SDA) for Aleppo. As of this release, UNOSAT is providing the SDA for Aleppo only, and will follow in early January 2017 with a CDA for Aleppo. All information for representing this data is the same as in #4 above. However, note that this dataset includes only shelter and housing areas for the most part, industrial areas are not yet included.
